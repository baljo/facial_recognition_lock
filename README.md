# How to unlock a door with facial recognition

## Problem statement

There are times when you wish you'd have three arms. For example when you arrive home with grocery shopping bags in both hands, rain is pouring down, and you need to find the door key to unlock and open the door, without letting the shopping bags get wet and dirty. One way to solve this is to use a facial recognition doorbell and door unlocking mechanism. As an additional benefit you can even get notifications when someone, e.g. a family member, has been recognized and opened the door as well as when an unknown person has stood in front of the door.

## Solution

To build this facial recognition POC, a M2 SoM Evaluation Board and a B524 SoM was used, together with the Person Sensor from Useful Sensors. Initially the plan was to only create a facial recognition doorbell, i.e. signalling somehow and sending a notification when a person was in front of the sensor. But to take it a step further, I wanted to see if it was possible to also do facial identification and not only recognition, meaning identifying **who** a person is, not only that it is a person.
